            <h3>Geographical Location: North America</h3>
            <p>Yellowstone is the first national park in the United States. It covers over 2.2 million acres, and
                provides an opportunity to see wildlife and explore geothermal areas. In fact, Yellowstone contains
                about half the world's active geysers.</p>
            <p>These unique opportunities also bring out a lot of bad decisions among the tourists. Every year visitors
                injure themselves or the wildlife by getting close to the animals. You can see examples of people making
                bad decisions by visiting <a
